# If a train travels at a speed of 80 km/h for 5 hours, how far will it have traveled? 
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the speed and time, 
#and calculates the distance.
#speed = float(input('Enter speed in km/h: '))
#time = float(input('Enter time travelled in hours: '))
#distance = speed * time
#print(distance)

# A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. 
# The factory has a maximum of 800 hours of machine time per week. 
# Product A requires 4 hours of machine time per unit, 
# while Product B requires 5 hours of machine time per unit. 
# Each unit of Product A generates 100 dollars in profit, 
# while each unit of Product B generates 150 in profit. 
# Write a program that asks the user for the number of units of each product to produce, 
# and then calculates and displays the total profit.
